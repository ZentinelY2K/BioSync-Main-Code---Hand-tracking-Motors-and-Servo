# BioSync Old Prototype
Continuation of my Documentation Repo (Science Fair Project 2025) for those who want the code to run themselves
# OverView
This is the code i used to make the first finished Prototype of my science fair Project, it uses Python and the Arduino IDE, working 
alongside each other to achieve a hand movement turned into robot driving

# Tech Stack
Python, Arduino IDE, MediaPipe, OpenCV

# How to Run
I used an enviorment to exclude Python 3.14 and use 3.10, since MediaPipe only supports up to Python 3.11,
this leads that you do need Python 3.10 to run this.
